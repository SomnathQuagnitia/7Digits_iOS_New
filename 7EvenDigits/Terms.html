                                        Disputes.

                                        Arbitration under this agreement shall be conducted under the then current rules of the American Arbitration Association: however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any current or future such rules or governing law, the arbitrator shall have no power to vary the terms of the TOS or to award you attorneys fees. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under these TOS shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other party subject to these TOS, whether through class arbitration proceedings or otherwise.

                                        Waiver and Severability of Terms. The failure of 7evendigits.com to exercise or enforce any right or provision of the TOS shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of the TOS is found to be invalid by an arbitrator or pursuant to the disputes section above a court of competent jurisdiction, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision. The other provisions of the TOS shall remain in full force and effect.

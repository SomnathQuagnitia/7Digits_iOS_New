                                    - Finally, a business card with a personality!  Our 7D professional profile not only includes the important information of your name, title, company and contact information but the "notes" section lets you tell people what makes you a success in your field.  Once you accept a 7D professional profile from another 7D-user, it is in your contact list and you can immediately call or chat with the person right away within the app on your phone.  You will never have to re-type, scan or run out of business cards again.
